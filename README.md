# A6.1 : Cinemagraph Concept (Markdown Writing Assignment) #
## _OUTSIDE_ ##
For my cinemagraph assignment I was thinking about:
1. _Standing in the middle_ of **field of tall grass.**
2. The sky would be the one _moving_ giving it a nice calming vibe
3. the sky whould be recorder for about:
* 2-4hr if i want to see colour change or
* about 15-30 mins to get the cloud moving
